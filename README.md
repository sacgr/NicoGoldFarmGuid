## FaQ
1. Do you need to use tinted glass
	- No you can use any block that is spawn pref(glass, leths, slabs)
2. Can it work on a paper server
	- The design is compatible with standard paper but modification that the server owner dos to the server can change the behavior of it and therefore brake it
