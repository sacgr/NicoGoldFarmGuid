## Description
It is a gold form that uses a player to load in and kill the pigmen in one dimension.
It uses boats to remove the pigmen from the mod cap to increase the rates of killing the mobs.
The farm was first described in Nicos video [*"How to Design the MOST Optimized Gold Farm [Nerf Proof!]"*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTSFuNXbjqo)
## Setup
### General information
- If lazy, place the schematic so that the top part of the glass is at build limit, this insures that you only need to spawn proof a small amount of area under the bedrock roof
- If you want marginally better rates, place it lower but this means that you need to spawn proof more area.
- The farm needs to be placed the [Nether Wastes Biome.](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Nether_Wastes)
### Nico's Design
- Place the schematic at your selected spot
- Somehow place in the boats
- You can fill the platform around the killing chamber(See photo 3)
- Replace the wool block with a hopper sticking into it with a storage system of your choosing.(See photo 2)
### Nico's design with LonelyKat's killing chamber
- Place the schematic in your selected spot
- Replace the killing chamber with the one that LonelyKat designed [see link](https://youtu.be/GN_RV3ush94)
- Replace the wool block with a hopper sticking into it with a storage system of your choosing.(See photo 2)
Enjoy Nico's and LonelyKat's engineering!
### MaggieDog's pre compiled upgrade (recommended)
- Place the schematic in your selected spot
- If you’re afraid of the leather burning replace them with glass
- Use LonelyKat's guide the get in the boats [see link](https://youtu.be/GN_RV3ush94)
- Enjoy Nico's, LonelyKat's and MaggieDog's engineering

### Paper servers
Works on the standard profile but can be changed by plugins that the owner adds, or change in spawning mechanics. If you are unsure if something has been changed, ask the owner for a config or if they’ve changed anything.
## How to use it

## FaQ
- Do you need to use tinted glass?
	- No, you can use any block that is spawn proof(glass, leaves, slabs, etc.)
- Can it work on a paper server?
	- The design is compatible with standard paper but modifications that the server owner does to the server can change the behavior of it and therefore breaks it 
- Why is there string in the schematic?
	- The sting is placed as a interface layer round the "hat" to avoid piglins from pathinding on to the platform
- Why is the armor stand decaying?
	- The problem is that you are using a sword with fire aspect
- Can you use soul fire instead of magma blocks?
	- Yes you can, but remember to fireproof the farm first
